So I copied the two header files that was given on canvas into the project.

I tried to implement the each functions in the header file by clicking on the lightbulb and click implement.
For each function, I overload the operators in the Point.cpp and Cluster.cpp

In main, I created multiple points and give them values to test the overloaded functions.
